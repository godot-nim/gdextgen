## How to update

Most of the files belonging to this repository are automatically generated by [coronation](https://github.com/godot-nim/coronation).
Install the version you wish to use, or a customized version of coronation, locally and run `nim sync` in the repository root.

See config.nims for details on the `nim sync` process.
By default, godot-cpp/godot-4.2.2-stable/gdextension/gdextension_api.json is used.
If you want to change the API definition to be used, rewrite the file name of the sync task.
